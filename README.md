# JavaScript Calculator üßÆ

This is a calculator built using plain JavaScript that supports basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentage calculations. Additionally, the calculator allows users to view a history of their calculations.

## üöÄ Calculator Features

- **Basic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentage calculations.
- **History Feature**: The calculator saves the operation history (entered numbers and results) to `sessionStorage` and displays it when the "History" button is clicked.
- **Keyboard Support**: The calculator responds to key presses on the keyboard (including digits, operators, and the Enter key to execute calculations).
- **Deleting Digits**: The "Delete" button removes the last entered digit, and the "AC" button resets the calculator.
- **On-Screen Buttons**: The calculator has buttons for numbers and operators that the user can click.

## üñ•Ô∏è How the Calculator Works

1. **Enter Numbers**: By clicking the number buttons, the user inputs the numbers to be used for calculations.
2. **Select an Operator**: After entering the first number, the user selects an operator (e.g., +, -, *, /).
3. **Enter the Second Number**: After selecting an operator, the user enters the second number.
4. **Calculate**: When the "=" button is clicked, the calculator performs the calculation and displays the result.
5. **History**: After the calculation, the result is saved to the history. The history of calculations can be viewed by clicking the "History" button.

## üîß Technologies Used

- **HTML** - Structure of the page
- **CSS** - Styling of the interface
- **JavaScript** - Calculator logic and user interaction

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

2. Open the index.html file in a browser to run the calculator.
## üìö Learning and Development
While creating this calculator, I learned how to write classes in JavaScript and how to use an object-oriented approach to structure the code. The implementation of the calculator allowed me to:

Create class instances,
Store the state of the calculator (numbers, operator, result),
Handle events and user interaction,
Store the calculation history in sessionStorage,
Handle keyboard input and mathematical operations.
